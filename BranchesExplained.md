# Branches explained
### Master
Master contains only "stable" code, meaning code that is at the very least tested against expected inputs and outputs. Code in this branch will always compile.

### Dev
Dev contains unstable and/or untested code that mostly consists of half-finished features. Code in this branch will always compile and "work".

### Broken-Testing
This branch contains not compileable and/or broken code that is not even finished enough to reach the dev branch. Mainly used to backup a days work and is expected to be cleaned up rather quickly. Code in this branch have no compilling garantee and should never be used in general.
